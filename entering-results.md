## Overview
Entering results (finish times or finish places) is dependent on the Results Type for the Class. If the Results Type is "Place" the system only allows the entry of a place (1, 2, 3, etc). If the Results Type is Time, the system allows the entry of finish times only.

In both cases the system has multiple ways in which the results can be entered. The most commonly used method is the One Click Finish. Using this method the minimum number of keystrokes is required. For a Class with a Results Type of Place, only a single click is required. For a Class with a Results Type of Time you are required to enter the actual finish time and then a single click. In the case of Time, the Corrected Time is automatically calculated and the correct finishing order is determined by the system. Points are automatically applied.

For all Results Types (Time or Place), special finish results can be applied with a single click. These include DNF, DNS, RAF etc.

The steps are the same for both Time and Place classes:

Open the Class Dashboard
In the Class Control panel click the Tick.png or Cog.png icon in the column corresponding to the required race number.
The system will open the Race page for the required race
Enter Finish Times or Places as described below
When all results are entered, change the Race Status to Published
Click Save & Exit
For all Results Types, the Race page is divided into 4 sections

Race Properties - For more details see Create Race
Finish Time and Place Functions - these functions are described below.
Finish Times and Places - This section shows a table of the boats which have finished, the place and points awarded, and, if the Result Type is Time, the Elapsed Time, TCF and Corrected Time.
Boats Not Yet Finished - This is a table of the boats which have not yet finished.

**Correcting Mistakes and Re-Ordering Finishers**

Quite often the Race Committee will correct their results or you may have made an error in entering them. There are 3 methods to correct errors.

Use Move Up/Down Arrows ![Arrow_up.png](images/Arrow_up.png) ![Arrow_down.png](images/Arrow_down.png)
Reset Race results ![Reset-race-button.png](images/Reset-race-button.png)
Use Finish Sheet Edit ![Finish-sheet-edit-button.png](images/Finish-sheet-edit-button.png)

**Move Up/Down Arrows** ![Arrow_up.png](images/Arrow_up.png) ![Arrow_down.png](images/arrow_down.png)

These icons allow you to move a boat one place up or down. When you click one of the arrows the boat is moved in the required direction and the adjacent boats are re-ordered and rescored.

### Entering Finish Times using One Click (Boat by boat) Entry

**This applies to a Class with a Results Type of TIME.**

Using the steps above, access the Race page for the required Class and Race. The picture below shows a sample IRC Class for race 11.

![Finish-by-time.png](images/Finish-by-time.png)

The picture shows that no boats have finished. For each finisher, select the Finish Code (FIN = normal finish), enter the finish time by overwriting the hhmmss then click the Tick.png in the Fin column.

You could use this method to finish the remainder of the class.

### Correcting Mistakes and Re-Ordering Finishers

Quite often the Race Committee will correct their results or you may have made an error in entering them. To correct the entry there are three methods:

Use ![Pencil.png](images/Pencil.png) to open the RaceResult screen. Edit the finish time and click Save.
Use ![Cross.png](images/Cross.png) to delete the finish result and re-enter it using the methods above.
Use Finish Sheet Edit ![Finish-sheet-edit-button.png](images/Finish-sheet-edit-button.png)
After changing a finish time, always recalculate the race results using the Reset-race-button.png

### DNF, DNS, DNC and OCS

The Race Committee will often score a boat DNF (Did Not Finish), DNS (Did Not Start), DNC (Did Not Compete) or OCS (On Course Side at Start) where the boat has not started or completed the course. To enter these scores quickly, click the required Score to the right of the Tick.png icon.

![Click-to-finish-place-3.png](images/Click-to-finish-place-3.png)

The system will score AUS5 DNF and move him to the Finish Times and Places table.

Note that there are many other special scores that could be used. These are available in the Select List to the left of the ![Tick.png](images/Tick.png)

This function will open a worksheet which allows you to manually adjust any or all of the results.

### Entering Protest Scores

Following a protest a boat which may have been scored as finished may need to be

- be scored as DSQ (disqualified)

- be scored in a specific place or with specific points
- be awarded redress in some form

It is vital to read the Jury decision carefully and consult with the Jury Secretary if there is any doubt.

**Scoring a Boat DSQ**
**Scoring a Boat with a specific place or points**
**Awarding a Boat Redress**

### Finish Times and Places Bulk Entry Using Finish Sheet

**Key Concepts**
