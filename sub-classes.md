The subclass feature assumes that all entrants in the subclass are also entrants in the parent class. Further that the subclass will be scored with its own points and based on relative positions. That is, if there are two boats (A and B) and, in the parent class A scores 3,5,7,4 and B scores 6,6,12,5, then their scores in the subclass (absent any other boats) will be A (1,1,1,1) and B (2,2,2,2).

The steps are:

- Create the Overall Class
- Add all entrants to this class
- Create each sub class and in the **Subclass** field select the parent class from the drop down
- For each subclass, go into the **Entries** screen. You will see a new button A**dd from Parent Class**. Click this and a screen will appear of all the entrants in the overall class that are NOT currently member of this class. Select the ones you want and save

When doing results:

- Enter the time/places for all boats in the Overall class first
- In each subclass race click load parent results
- System will load the results from the parent and recalculate for within this class
- Works for time or place scoring
